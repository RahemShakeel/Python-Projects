# Tip-Calculator-Python
A simple code that helps you calculate the amount each person needs to pay after including a tip based on the percentage specified by you.

## Description
The Tip Calculator is a straightforward command-line tool that:
- Takes the total bill amount.
- Prompts for the number of people splitting the bill.
- Asks for the tip percentage.
- Computes the tip amount and the total amount per person.

- **Split Bill**: Divide the total amount (including tip) by the number of people.
- **Rounded Result**: The result is rounded to two decimal places for easier readability.

## Background
I created this Tip Calculator while learning Python. This project was part of me learning, use of variables, user input, and simple arithmetic operations. It was a great way to practice and reinforce these foundational skills.
